Welcome!



You will hear a repeated rhythm played by a tone. 

There will also be a "bass sound", playing a regular pulse. 

Tap in synchrony with the bass sound on SPACEBAR. 


If your tapping is precise, the bass sound will get softer and softer. 

Eventually (if you are tapping well), the bass sound will disappear. 

Keep your internal pulse as the bass sound fades out. 

Keep tapping at the positions where the bass sound was before. 



Good luck!
