Welcome to the main experiment. 


Here you will be presented with similar rhythms as in the training. 
However, there are some important differences. 
1. No bass sound will be presented to mark the beat. 
2. The rhythm will not be repeated over and over again, but it will keep changing. 

Now, your task will be as follows: 

When the rhythm starts, find a plausible regular pulse and synchronize your 
taps to it on SPACEBAR. Keep tapping until the sound stops completely. 
If you lose the pulse, try to find it again as soon as you can. 

Do not forget, there are many different plausible pulses that might work. 

Do not worry if you tap to some silences as well. 
As long as the pulse you are tapping feels natural and synchronized to 
the rhythm you hear, you are doing great!
