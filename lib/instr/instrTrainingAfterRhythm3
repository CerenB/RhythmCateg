Great job! Great tapping! 


So this was a different rhythm. 

One thing to notice is that when the bass sound disappeared, 
some of your taps did not coincide with actual sounds anymore. 

This actually happens very often when we listen to music. 

Important lesson to remember: 
We can perceive pulse that we somehow fit to the rhythm. 
The pulse does not have to always coincide with sounds. 
But, it is still synchronized to the rhythm we hear. 


Ok, one final example. Whenever you are ready!
