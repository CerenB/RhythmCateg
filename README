Requirements: 
    - Matlab 
    - Psychtoolbox

To run: 
    - First, download the stimuli by executing downloadStimuli bash script. 
    - Run tapTrainer_PTB.m in Matlab. 
    - This will launch the ptb session. 

During the session, rhythms are presented with sounds marking the meter (one 
sound for beat, the other playing the fastest metric level). 

The task is to tap on SPACEBAR along with the beat. Good tapping performance
will result in gradual decrease of meter-sounds volume. Eventually, the
meter-sounds will disappear and the subject is required to keep synchronized
to the beat. 

Multiple rhythmic patterns with increasing difficulty can be used, as well as
different beat periods.
